# EDA-Capstone-Play-Store-App-Review-Analysis

The goal of this Capstone project was to perform an analysis of app data reviews for the Google Play Store, with a focus on medical and health fitness apps. The main objective was to build an app for medical and health fitness categories.

The problem statement of the project was to understand the user feedback and their opinions about existing medical and health fitness apps in the Google Play Store and to use this information to make recommendations for the development of a new app in this category.

To address this problem, the first step was to gather a large dataset of app reviews from the Google Play Store. The data were then pre-processed and 


cleaned to remove any irrelevant information. Next, exploratory data analysis was performed to gain insights into the data and to identify any patterns or trends in the reviews.

One of the key approaches used in the project was sentiment analysis. This involved using natural language processing techniques to classify the reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. The results of this analysis were used to gain an understanding of the overall sentiment of the reviews and to identify any areas of the existing apps that users were particularly unhappy with.

In conclusion, the results of the analysis showed that users generally had positive feedback about existing medical and health fitness apps in the Google Play Store. However, some users had concerns about the accuracy of the information provided by the apps and the effectiveness of their features. Based on these findings, the new app being developed should prioritize accurate information and effective features to address these user concerns.
